   <!-- Whether WiFi display is supported by this device.
         There are many prerequisites for this feature to work correctly.
         Here are a few of them:
         * The WiFi radio must support WiFi P2P.
         * The WiFi radio must support concurrent connections to the WiFi display and
           to an access point.
         * The Audio Flinger audio_policy.conf file must specify a rule for the "r_submix"
           remote submix module.  This module is used to record and stream system
           audio output to the WiFi display encoder in the media server.
         * The remote submix module "audio.r_submix.default" must be installed on the device.
         * The device must be provisioned with HDCP keys (for protected content).

         a protected hardware path for surface flinger to composite and send
         protected buffers to the wifi display video encoder.
         If this flag is false, we advise applications not to use protected
         buffers (if possible) when presenting content to a wifi display because
         the content may be blanked.
         This flag controls whether the {@link Display#FLAG_SUPPORTS_PROTECTED_BUFFERS}
         flag is set for wifi displays.
